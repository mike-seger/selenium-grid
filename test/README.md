# Test examples for several languages
Every provided example contains a smoke test of the selenium grid and its supported drivers within its own subdirectory.  

Each directory has its own instructions and contains a file called **configuration.json**.
You can override the configuration values by providing another **configuration.json** in the root of each directory. This will be merged into the tests and is ignored by **.gitignore**.
